    <h1><uppercase><i>Legends Of Madrid</i></uppercase></h1><br><br>

    <h2><uppercase><i>The marketing furore around his transfer might be all that anyone remembers of David Beckham becoming a Galactico – but Goldenballs was a success in Spanish football. Beckham didn't play in a side that conquered all before them but his contribution to the 2006/07 title – as his contract was expiring – was exactly what the Merengues bought the England captain for.

        <h2><uppercase><i>Forever doubted throughout his career, Luka Modric has helped not only change perceptions about himself but players like him. A dimunitive midfielder who uses ball-carrying as much as passing to evade pressure, he's not just been a creative spark in four Champions League titles but a vital figure when the chips have been down. His Ballon d'Or was testament to the sheer beauty of what he do with a ball.</i></uppercase></h2>

        <h2><uppercase><i>Sergio Ramos was born to lead Real Madrid. Brash, brazen and brilliant in equal part, the centre-back commanded the Merengues' defence first from right-back before moving into the centre and coming to define the position in fans' eyes.

            Not only was Ramos an exceptional defender with pace, physicality, aggression and aerial prowess, however, he would chip in at the other end with goals. He left Real with 101 in all competitions – some of them penalties – and typified the never-say-die attitude that was forged in the Champions League-winning sides of the 2010s. 
            
            He left with his name a part of 22 trophy successes, having racked up almost 700 games in white. For some, he is the ultimate Real hero: flawed, of course, but always playing his heart on one of those rolled-up sleeves. </i></uppercase></h2>

    <h2><uppercase><i>No one has ever played at 100% of their physical capacity quite as often as Cristiano Ronaldo. No one has ever had his blend of physicality, speed, touch and movement – and no one has ever scored more goals. For Real Madrid, or for anyone. 

        By the time he'd departed the Bernabeu, CR7 had 450 in fewer games than that. Every season he was at Real, he scored over 30 goals a season: twice, he hit over 60. He wasn't a man, he was a machine. He gradually earned a reputation for single-handedly propelling this team to glory, whether or not they were playing well or not.
        
        Because aside from everything he had physically, Ronaldo arguably had the most driven mentality of any footballer to ever pull on Los Blancos colours. 15 titles in eight years – and a bag full of memories of overhead kicks, El Clasico strikes, impossible finishes, hat-tricks and moments of magic – cemented him as the greatest player in the club's history. According to some, he's the best-ever…</i></uppercase></h2>
