                    <h2><uppercase><i>In world football, no other club competition quite matches up to the popularity and the pull of the men's UEFA Champions League (UCL).

                        The tournament features the best teams from Europe vying for the coveted trophy and the bragging rights to be called ‘Europe’s best’ each year.
                        
                        While other continental federations like Asian Football Confederation, Confederation of African Football and South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) also run their own continental Champions League equivalents, the overwhelming popularity of European football around the world makes the UCL stand out. Real Madrid are the kings of the Champions League, standing alone as the club to win Europe's premier tournament on the most occasions, with their first coming back in the inaugural European Cup in 1956.

                        They went on to win the first five editions of the tournament, and the culture of winning European trophies has been instilled into the club ever since. 
                        
                        Having already claimed aggregate-goal triumphs over French champions PSG, English Premier League champions Manchester City, and Champions League holders Chelsea, Madrid secured a 14th Champions League triumph in 2021-22 by defeating Liverpool in the final.
                        
                        We look back at their past glories in the competition and take a closer look at the history of Europe's most successfull club.</i></uppercase></h2><br><br>

                        <h2><uppercase><i>The Copa del Rey is an annual knockout football competition in Spanish football, organized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, held annually since 1903. The competition is open to Primera and Segunda División teams, plus some qualifiers from lower levels.[1]

                            Since the first final between Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid, 122 single-match finals have taken place (the 1904 final was not held, whereas in 1910 and 1913 two parallel tournaments and finals were played due to disagreements between the FECF and the UECF, both considered official; in 2023, the RFEF retrospectively announced that they recognized the 1937 Copa de la España Libre as an official tournament won by Levante FC, distinct from the Copa del Rey.</i></uppercase></h2><br><br><br>

                            <h2><uppercase><i>Real Madrid actually won the trophy in 1989 as well, although no tournament took place that year. As Los Blancos won both the league and cup in the 1988/89 season, they were automatically awarded another crown.

                                They would go on to win the next two Supercopas they participated in too, beating Barcelona in the final on both occasions. In fact, over the four legs, they went unbeaten.
                                
                                Madrid would go on to beat Barcelona again in 1997 before victories against Real Zaragoza, Mallorca and Valencia in the next 21 years. Since 2012, the capital side have won four Supercopa titles, most recently against Athletic Club in 2022.
